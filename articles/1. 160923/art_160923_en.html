		<p id="title">Why the hell a personal blog?</p>
		<p id="subtitle"> The reasons that brought me to create a blog and not using the usual social medias.</p>

		<div id="stuff">

			<p>A few social medias which masses of people use: Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook (still in use today by old and boomers), Reddit, TikTok, WeChat, X (farewell birdy), Tumblr, and I may have lost some of them (I do not consider Telegram and Whatsapp since they're instant messaging platforms). Of these, the most I used in my experience was Reddit (almost three years of service o7), followed by Instagram (not even a year of use)</p>

			<p>Reddit aside, I've always disliked these social medias. I felt and feel disgust and scorn towards them. This disfavor is due without any doubt to my character, shy and private; and I've never liked their inner workings and design for which they had success (since I was a kid, I thought that there was some kind of rule which made mandatory for every user to post photos, personal or not, on these platforms). And the thing I can't stand, the numbers: Instagram's Play Store page reports that the app has been downloaded by more than <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android&hl=it&gl=US">5 billions people</a>, while for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&hl=it&gl=US">X</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&hl=it&gl=US">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically&hl=it&gl=US">TikTok</a> more than a billion each. And let's not talk about the online time spent by every single user.</p>

			<p>My disapproval has been always escorted by the lack of an answer for the following question: why should the human share his experiences? Why XY should publish online a photo of him/herself or the food s/he's going to eat? Or a landscape after a 4 hours walk?
			We may go back even further, to the roots: why the primitive human told its fellows that the day before he managed to hunt a big animal, or built a house?
			I've never been able to find an answer to all of this. And when in october/november I posted online a few photos on Instagram, I felt I was contradicting myself.</p>

			<p>Two months ago, my patience had its end, I couldn't no more keep everything for myself and to receive that kind of reaction. I want to express myself. But how? By which means?
			I immediatly discarded all social media mentioned earlier: because of all the reaons mentioned above, adding the privacy question which everybody in this planets cares a lot, and finally a fundamental reason: every social media applies its omologation. Examples? The maximum quantity of characters allowed in a tweet it's <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/counting-characters">280</a>; an Instagram story can contain a video which can last at most 60 seconds; on Reddit you can post only on certain subreddits, depending on the content; and so on. (Personal vent: al the photos I see on Instagram looks all the same. Everybody picturing the same buildings, picturing themselves the same way. I can't say I value a photo more than another since they're both the same by idea and I find nothing innovative.)</p>

			<p>Out of nowhere I got the idea: what about building a blog? Without thinking too much about pros and cons, I immediately started writing straight away the first page (this article in a more raw way). The day after, the fateful question: why should I ever do that? What's the sense of sharing my things with unknown people who may not care at all? Why sharing?</p>

			<p>The fact I had no answer led me to abandon and lose interest in this project.</p>

			<p>While discussing with friends, I asked the question that was torturing me. And which were the answers? There's not an obvious clear reason, because that's in human nature. He has always done that and he will always do that. Wow. Nobody could dispute my idea and project.</p>
		
			<p>So, here we are: you're inside my idea.</p>

			<p>Who may care of what I have to say? Potentially, absolutely to nobody. Is it a problem to me? No. This thing does not hurt me. This blog it my public square in which the stage it's all mine (with its related costs, but for now only in terms of time). I may consider this blog like some sort of personal diary, where I arrange and sort my ideas, new informations, and process everything I have to get to a final thought.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Now some technical details.<br>

			My site is kept online by <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, so the maximum quantity of content (texts, pictures, videos, gifs, etc) can't go beyond 1 gigabyte. So, in the future, I'll have to change service and, with it, the URL. But for now, it's more than enough.<br>

			All this blog is programmed row by row all by keyboard, keeping me busy for hours and without using graphical point-and-click tools which could have reduced all this work to a 15 time work. As you can see, my graphical skills are not high; with time going on, things will change: if I'm sick with something I'll change it, I'll decide to improve whatever I want, to add, delete, update, etc etc etc. <br>

			For now, web pages are static, meaning that they're the same everytime you'll connect to it (or updating it): what I'd want is making them dynamic, that they'd change aspect from log to log. For example, showing different images, different colors, different texts, and so on. <br>

			There will be a "Random" section in which I'll put random things randomly. Yes. It can be anything: from memes, quotes, idiotic gifs, album covers, and so on. </p>

			<br>
		
			<p>What's left to say? Nothing, for now. But ideas for new articles will come: every of them will require time to born, to be processed, to be formatted, and published. But at least, this is the first page of this diary.</p>
