		<p id="title">Updates from University</p>

		<div id="stuff">

			<p>Hello everybody, it's been a while I've not written anything, and lot of things happened. One month has passed by, but this doesn't prevent me to tell something about my new univerity life even if, in the end, I'm living only the 5% of what should be the true experience.</p>

			<p>If during high school the time needed to get to school and get back home was around two hours (or even less, 45 minutes round trip), now it has doubled. I've still have to catch the same bus to get to the station, and then another bus that brings me to University. It's kinda a break-my-balls-off, in fact I'm working on the driving license, and I hope to get it within the end of the year.</p>

			<p>I applied for IT Engineering, hoping it to be the right way for me (see the uncertainty :,) ). The beginning could have been better or worse, it depends on the point of view. Despite it, what I tell to people is "I hope this to be the most boring semester of my carrer"; I've four subjects: Math Analysis 1, Chemistry, Physics and IT. <br>
			Math Analysis 1 is more difficult of what I experienced, a lot of definitions and demonstrations to care about, and to be honest I'm doing almost no exercices, I should repair.<br>
			Chemistry: third-year-high-school stuff with some elements from the fifth year; long short story, from moles to Schr√∂dinger.<br>
			Physics: 5-years-high-school topics in two semesters; from uniform rectilinear motion to relativity theory. At least I've the support of integrals and derivates which simplify a lot the study, I can avoid memorizing 23572352037590 formulas of which a big part doesn't suggest me even the slightest meaning.<br>
			IT: no mention. Basic programming. A total waste of time for me (I think and hope, someday I'll rush all lessons recorded by the professor).<br></p>

			<p>Sometimes I think about this fact: right now I'm into already known topics faced at high school, and for me it's boring. At the same time, I think about all my colleagues in different university faculties such as Medicine, fine arts; I heard from them that since the first semester they had totally new subjects, and so I think: isn't it difficult to study all that mastodontic quantity of stuff? How many times these students may feel discouraged? And then I think about me. I've four subjects this semester, already known and that bring nothing new. I may consider myself lucky to had this soft start instead of a trauma.</p>

			<p>My general judgment about the professors is neutral, all of them do their duty. Aside my physics professor, who prefers quantistic one to the classical one; he teaches it (in my opinion) pretty badly. But good for him until he stops being happy and cheerful at lessons. I'm on my way alone with the book.</p>

			<p>The Engineering Department is made up of more or less 4 or 5 buildings, and I think it's pretty simple to orientate and understanding where to go since the first day. In general, the look and feel is up to date, the buildings aren't ancient and equipment for teaching (projectors, computers, graphic tablets, etc) are working fine. What is not fine sometimes is wifi network, but since there are more than 500 students connected at the same, I'd say the occasional missing web page is accettable.</p>

			<p>The first time I went to the University Canteen I was frightened. "Guess what, I'm going to leave here wallet here for a plate of pasta". I don't remember if I paid it 1 or 2 euros and thirty cents,. But it doesn't matter, my mind blew when I discovered it. I was constantly asking myself how the hell could the University keep this low prices for all that students coming for lunch, when in a bar a sandwhich and a Coca-Cola cost 5 euros, but then I stopped thinking about it.</p>

			<p>The library is well equipped and I borrow from there books needed for studying. At least, for now I got only the physics textbook, and it isn't requested as much as Analysis' one. But it's all right.<br>
			I once went in Library with a colleague to study physics, and at some point the guy in front of us told us: "Guys, go away from here, you've broken my balls."<br>

			So, my dear.<br>
			
			The study hall, called like that because available for studying sessions, was occupied by students who were playing cards. We checked the library and we got at the back of it, to where there was the least number of people, that rightly grew with time. In the end, we were whispering all the time. So, it's ok complaining about us, but only with the right regards :) .
